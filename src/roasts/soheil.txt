What is Their Most Used Phrase/Quote/Emoji? I hope Soheil will take part in the DataChef dinner, apparently they had to organize it at the restaurant right next to his house to make sure that he will go;Soheil could automate himself out of this job, but likes to keep putting food on the table, so writes code only he understands with zero documentation.;Soheil has not turned on his camera in so long. We are not even sure anymore if he is real or just AI generated.;He is so lazy and leave the house with difficulty, like to stay at home always ;The most shy person you ever meet in your life. He is the definition of being introvert. Dude once got a vacation and spent it alone!;He doesn't like to go for a little bit far restaurant in Tehran for good food :));The quiet mastermind behind the scenes, keeping all our IT services running smoothly while we pretend we know what’s going on.
